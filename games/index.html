			<td class="tg-s6z2"><p>Apr 2018<br>Porsche Ring - my first 3D Godot game.<br>It's a racing game, for which I've created everything myself, except Godot-boy model and track texture. I like that Porsche model, but it needs more work. I don't have a page for it in Blender section yet, but if you like it and/or need it, I can fix remaining issues and provide a download. The game features standard Godot car physics, it has a lap with checkpoints and lap timer. Actually fun to play. Try to get sub 20 sec. You can see an attempt of making a modular track on the side, but it was abandoned, as Godot didn't (doesn't still?) have hex-tileset workflow, and I didn't want to make is square-based.</a><br>It is not optimised at all, so you can try to <a href="/games/porsche_ring/Porsche Ring.html">play Porsche Ring</a> online, if your PC can handle it, or <a href="/games/porsche_ring/PorscheRing.zip">download a Windows build</a> of it, it will run just fine.</p></td>

			<td class="tg-s6z2"><p>Dec 2017<br>Tic Tac Toe - my first "big" Godot game.<br>It is a 3x3 and 5x5 Tic Tac Toe game, where you can play hotseat with friend, 3x3 TTT against "simple AI" (it just fills random empty spots on it's turn), or launch 2 builds in local network and establish a chat between 2 computers. Unfortunately, you will have to manually make your opponent's moves on your field :)<br>It was supposed to have full multiplayer and a strong minimax AI, but I had no idea how to create them at the time. This is still certainly a non-featureless project in other spheres, and that's why I post it.<br>You can <a href="/games/ttt3/TicTacToe3.0.html">try it online</a>, but you should definitely check out <a href="/games/ttt3/TicTacToe3.0.zip">the Windows build</a> and play with it's "multiplayer" stuff.<br>Of cource - <a href="/games/ttt3/TicTacToe3.0_source.zip">source code</a>.</p></td>
